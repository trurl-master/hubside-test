Hello!

And welcome to this beautiful (and weird) application.

Please `npm install` before launching it using `npm start`.
It's created with simple create-react-app and is using localStorage to store your awesome lists.

This is a MVP you requested, but it wasn't too hard to make it almost entirely usable using keyboard (hope it will gain us some valuable users after launch)
