    1. Todos is an array and it won't change either, only items of the array will change, so const please

    2. I'd prefer using integer ID's, integer comparison is faster than string comparison, when you need to lookup the item in a very long list, but string is acceptable

    3. In case the order of todo items is not an issue, I'd use id as a key, the lookup of the item (and addition) would have been much easier.

    4. Usually a todo task has some sort of state like NEW, IN-PROGRESS, DONE and so forth... ?
    
    Note: 3 is here because I don't see an API entry to update order of items, but usually todo is sortable, so it can be ignored

    1. The existence of the item with the same ID should be checked before addition and in my opinion it's a strange way of creating ID's. Depending on the situation simple integer ID with increment on POST /todos may be acceptable

    2. As ID is being generated on the server side it is a good practice to return at least this ID in the response, full item is prefered
